// PennantFeatures: the app's departments and its window shell (SWIFTUI_REBUILD.md section 6). Each department is a
// target exporting one `DepartmentModule` (its views as descriptors); the app target assembles them into the
// registry the sidebar, the Go menu and search come from. `FeatureCore` holds the registry's types and the
// navigation history; `Shell` the main window, the server states and Settings; `Setup` the first-run window.
// Nothing here decides a baseball question: every sentence and number shown is served, and the rest is structural
// labels in the app's String Catalog.
