/// - **asking to quit** (`requestQuit()`) never calls `NSApp.terminate` directly: it schedules it on the main run
///   loop, which also runs inside that nested loop, so it is safe from a `Task`, a main-queue block, a menu command or
///   another thread (the SIGTERM handler);
/// - **the stop and the reply** (`shouldTerminate`) do not need the main queue: the server is stopped on a detached
///   task (the controller is an actor), and the reply is delivered through the main run loop.
/// Quit only through `requestQuit()`.
