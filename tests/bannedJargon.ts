/**
 * The words the GM never reads in visible text (AGENTS.md "Writing for the GM", D-056): one list for every page test
 * and for every string the Mac app can show (`text`, `hint` and `display` in a `/api/v2` payload). A method word, a
 * doc id, a column name or a rendering leak may stand in a hover or a breakdown where it helps, never on the face.
 *
 * It replaced the per-page copies (Contracts, Free Agents, Payroll, the Trade Center, the value section, the roster,
 * the lineup, the player card, Org Comparison and the yardsticks line); each page now checks all of it. A word added
 * here is banned everywhere at once. A page's own rule that is not about jargon (Org Comparison states no rank) stays
 * in its test. The String Catalog check in the Mac app reads the same list (N3).
 *
 * Three patterns are marginally narrower than a page's old copy, accepted at N2: "pays for talent" (the philosophy's
 * lean) is allowed, `\bOff Value\b` no longer matches "Off Values", and a doc id needs a word boundary ("AD-012" passes).
 * The list was tuned on Player Value's pages and applies to every `/v2` string. A plain word it would reject on one
 * surface ("PCT" in the standings column's glossary entry, "waiver priority" on the 40-man view) gets a scoped
 * exception (`JARGON_EXCEPTIONS`: one phrase, one surface, one line saying why), never a weaker pattern: the phrase is
 * allowed there and only there, and every other word of the same string is still checked.
