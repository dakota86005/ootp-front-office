/**
 * Writes a synthetic league into a folder, for running the Mac app or its integration test on something that is
 * never a real save (SWIFTUI_REBUILD.md section 8):
 *
 *   npm run synthetic:league -- <folder>
 *
 * The folder gets `league.db`: the test fixture league (`tests/fixture.ts`) rewritten by `tests/syntheticSave.ts`
 * to the contract tests' shape (four clubs, a 60-game season half played, one season of history). Point the app
 * at the folder as its data folder (DEVELOPMENT.md "The Mac app"). A folder that already has a `league.db`
 * is left alone. Nothing here reads or writes `data/` or the real data folder.
