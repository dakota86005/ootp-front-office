# Pennant for Mac (the SwiftUI rebuild): working reminder

This is a router, not the doctrine. The canonical detail is in `docs/SWIFTUI_REBUILD.md` and `docs/DECISIONS.md`
D-055 to D-060 (with D-001, D-008, D-018, D-020, D-041, D-049 and D-052's amendment of 2026-09-25). Where this file
and those documents differ, they win. The presentation cases are in `docs/BEHAVIOR_CASES.md` "Pennant for Mac".

- **The server decides and writes; Swift renders.** Swift code holds no baseball threshold, computes no ranking,
  place or verdict, and writes no copy beyond structural labels (menu, tab and column names in the String Catalog).
  A number shown is a number served. If a view needs a sentence or a judgment, add it to the server's payload.
- **Every visible sentence is a server `Claim`, `Row` or `Cell`** under `/api/v2/`, with its basis. Keep the
  plain-language rule (AGENTS.md "Writing for the GM") in the TypeScript that authors it; the banned-jargon list is
  one file, `tests/bannedJargon.ts`, and a script checks the String Catalog against it.
- **The contract is generated.** Change TypeScript types, run `npm run contract:build`, commit `contract/openapi.json`.
  Never hand-write a Swift model of a server type. Closed unions are open enums; game dates are unpadded strings,
  never parsed as dates in Swift.
- **Unknown stays unknown** in Swift too: a null sort key sorts last both ways, a missing value shows the served
  sentence, never zero, a dash read as zero, or an empty chart that looks like "none".
- **Server changes are additive while the React app lives.** New tables and files only; old routes keep working;
  the data folder is shared with the Electron app (D-049 hold) and protected by `server.lock`.
- **Glass on the controls layer only**; content opaque; colour never the only signal; every depth layer keyboard- and
  VoiceOver-reachable. macOS 26 minimum: a macOS 27 API only behind `#available` with a macOS 26 path.
- **Never commit** save data, fixtures from a private save (fixtures come from `tests/syntheticSave.ts`), signing
  material, provisioning profiles, team secrets or `xcuserdata`.
- New Swift or npm dependencies need the owner's approval (SWIFTUI_REBUILD.md section 9 lists the approved set).
- **The sidecar (N1)** is the same server started by the app: token and keys on stdin, never in the environment;
  `PENNANT_READY` / `PENNANT_FAILED` on stdout; a clean stop on SIGTERM or stdin closing; the data-folder lock
  (`server.lock`) on every server start. SWIFTUI_REBUILD.md section 5.1 "As built" has the protocol and exit codes.
- **Widen `paths:` as the rebuild lands.** Add `server/presentation/**` in the milestone that creates its first tracked
  file (N4); `tests/agentInstructions.test.ts` rejects a path that matches nothing yet.
- **The contract pipeline (N2):** `npm run contract:build` writes `contract/openapi.json`; `tests/contract.test.ts` fails
  on drift, on a `/v2` route missing from `server/contract/routes.ts`, and on a live response outside its schema.
  PennantAPI reads the spec through a link, never a copy; `swift build && swift test` in `macos/Packages/PennantAPI`.
  Ids and counts are `Integer`; export a concrete alias of a generic, never the generic; read events through
  `ServerEventReading` (a known type that did not decode is `malformed`, never ignored).
- **The app skeleton (N3):** `ServerController`, `AppModel`, the event client, routes, the comparator and backups live in
  PennantKit; the server reaches the bundle through `npm run mac:stage` and the "Embed the server" build phase (the
  repository's `node_modules` is never rebuilt for it). Run a Debug build or a test only on a scratch data folder
  (`PENNANT_DEV_DATA_DIR`, `npm run synthetic:league`), never the real one or `data/`. SWIFTUI_REBUILD.md sections 5.2,
  5.3 and 6, "As built at N3", have the details.
- Verify with `macos/scripts/test.sh` plus the server baseline; visual checks come from XCUITest and
  `ImageRenderer` PNGs, not from asking the owner to look.
